# Uses the smbus2 library to send and receive data from a Tic.
# Works on Linux with either Python 2 or Python 3.
#
# NOTE: The Tic's control mode must be "Serial / I2C / USB".
# NOTE: For reliable operation on a Raspberry Pi, enable the i2c-gpio
#   overlay and use the I2C device it provides (usually /dev/i2c-3).
# NOTE: You might nee to change the 'SMBus(3)' line below to specify the
#   correct I2C device.
# NOTE: You might need to change the 'address = 11' line below to match
#   the device number of your Tic.
